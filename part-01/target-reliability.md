# Target Reliability
here are my edits and suggestions
## General Aspects

 In terms of a reliability based approach the structural risk
 acceptance criteria correspond to a required minimum reliability
 herein defined as *target reliability*. The requirements to the safety
 of the structure are consequently expressed in terms of *the accepted
 minimum reliability index* or *the accepted maximum failure
 probability*.

 In a rational analysis the target reliability is considered as a
 control parameter subject to *optimization*. The parameter assigns a
 particular investment to the material placed in the structure. The
 more material - invested in right places - the less is the expected
 loss. Such optimization is mainly possible when economic loss
 components dominate over life, injury, and culture components. When
 the expected loss of life or limb is important, the optimal
 reliability level becomes more controversional. Frequently, this leads
 to the problem of the economic equivalent of human life; *risk-benefit
 analyses* are then applied to circuvent this difficulty; the
 *reliability of the system is translated into the cost per life
 saved*. The target reliability may then be chosen such that the cost
 per life saved is at acceptable levels (for example comparable to
 other similar systems).

 In a practical approach the required reliability of the structure is
 controlled by:

i)  a set of assumptions about *quality assurance* and *quality
    management* measures; these measures are for example related to
    design and construction supervision and are intended to avoid *gross
    errors*.

ii) formal failure probability requirements, *conditional upon these
    assumptions*, defined by specified target values for the various
    classes of structures and structural members.

## Recommendations

 Target reliability values are provided in the next paragraphs. They
 are based on optimization procedures and on the assumption that for
 allmost all engineering facilities the only reasonable reconstruction
 policy is systematic rebuilding or repair.

### Ultimate Limit States

 Target reliability values for ultimate limit states are proposed in
 Table 1. The values in Table 1 are obtained based on cost benefit
 analysis for the public at characteristic and representative 
 but simple example structures and are compatible with calibration
 studies and statistical observations.

The shadowed value in Table 1 should be considered as the most common
 design situation. In order to make the right choice in this table the
 following guidelines may be of help:

-   **Consequence classes**

 A classification into consequenze classes is based on the ratio $\rho$
 defined as the ratio between total costs (i.e. construction costs plus
 direct failure costs) and construction costs.

 _Class 1 Minor Consequences:_ $\rho$ is less than approximately 2

 Risk to life, given a failure, is small to negligible and economic
 consequences are small or negligible (e.g. agricultural structures,
 silos, masts);

 _Class 2 Moderate Consequences:_ $\rho$ is between 2 and 5.

 Risk to life, given a failure, is medium or economic consequences are
 considerable (e.g. office buildings, industrial buildings, apartment
 buildings).

 _Class 3 Large Consequences:_ $\rho$ is between 5 and 10.

 Risk to life, given a failure, is high, or economic consequences are
 significant (e.g. main bridges, theaters, hospitals, high rise
 buildings).

 If $\rho$ is larger than 10 and the absolute value of *H* also is large,
 the consequences should be regarded as extreme and a full cost benefit
 analysis is recommended. The conclusion might be that the structure
 should not be build at all.

 One should be aware of the fact that failure consequences also depend
 on the type of failure, which can be classified according to:

a)  ductile failure with reserve strength capacity resulting from strain
    hardening

b)  ductile failure with no reserve capacity

c)  brittle failure

 Consequently a structural element which would be likely to collapse
 suddenly without warning should be designed for a higher level of
 reliability than one for which a collapse is preceded by some kind of
 warning which enables measures to be taken to avoid severe
 consequences.

 The values given relate to the structural system or in approximation
 to the dominant failure mode or structural component dominating system
 failure. Therefore, structures with multiple, equally important
 failure modes should be designed for a higher level of reliability.

-   **Relative cost of safety measures classificaton**

 The normal class (B) should be associated with:

-   medium variabilities of the total loads and resistances (0.1 \< *V*
    \< 0.3),

-   relative cost of safety measure

-   normal design life and normal obsolesce rate composed to
    construction costs of the order of 3%

 The given values are for structures or structural elements as designed
 (not as built). Failures due to human error or ignorance and failures
 due to non-structural causes are not covered by table 1.

 Values outside the given ranges may lead to a higher or lower
 classification. In particular attention may be given to the following
 aspects:

-   *Degree of Uncertainty*

 A large uncertainty in either loading or resistance (coefficients of
 variation larger then 40 %), as for instance the case of many
 accidental and seismic situations, a lower reliability class should be
 used. The point is that for these large uncertainties the additional
 costs to achieve a high reliability are prohibitive. If on the other
 hand both acting and resisting variables have coefficients of
 variation smaller than 10%, like for most dead loads and well-known
 small resistance variability, a higher class can be achieved by very
 little effort and this should be done.

-   *Quality assurance* and *inspections*

 Quality assurance (for new structures) and inspections (for existing
 structures) have an increasing effect on costs. This will lead to a
 lower reliability class. On the other hand, due to QA and inspections
 the uncertainty will normally decrease and a higher class becomes
 economically more attractive. General rules are difficult to give.

-   *Existing structures*

 For existing structures the costs of achieving a higher reliability
 level are usually high compared to structures under design. For this
 reason the target level for existing structures usually should be
 lower.

-   *Service life and/or obsolesce*

 For structures designed for short service life or otherwise rapid
 obsolesce (say less than 10 years) the beta-values can be lowered by
 one or half a class.

 By definition serviceability failures are not associated with loss of
 human life or limb. For existing structures the demand will be more
 related to the actual situation in performance and use. No general
 rules are given in this document.

### Serviceability Limit State

 When setting target values for serviceability limit states (SLS) it is
 important to distinguish between irreversible and reversible
 serviceability limit states. Target values for SLS can be derived
 based on decision analysis methods.

 For irreversible serviceability limit states tentative target values
 are given in Table 2. A variation from the target serviceability
 indexes of the order of 0.3 can be considered. For reversible
 serviceability limit states no general values are given.
