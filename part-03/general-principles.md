# General Principles

## Introduction

The description of each material property consists of a mathematical model (e.g. elastic-plastic model, creep model, etc.) and random variables or random fields (e.g. modulus of elasticity, creep coefficient). Functional relationships between the various variables may be part of the material model (e.g. the relation between tensile stress and compressive stress for concrete).  

In general, it is the response to static and time dependent mechanical loading that matters for structural design. However, also the response to physical, chemical and biological actions is important as it may affect the mechanical properties and behaviour.

It is understood that modelling is an art of reasonable simplification of reality such that the outcome is sufficiently explanatory and predictive in an engineering sense. An important aspect of an engineering models also is its operationability, i.e. the ease in handling it inapplications.

Models and values should follow from (standardised) tests, representing the actual
environmental and loading conditions as good as possible. The set of tested specimen should be representative for the production of the relevant fabrication sites, cover a sufficient long period of time
and may include the effect of standard quality control measures. Allowance should be made for possible differences between test circumstances and structural environment (conversion).

For the classical building materials, knowledge about the various properties is generally available from
experience and from tests in the past. For new materials models and values should be obtained from an
extensive and well defined testing program.
