# Introduction

This part treats the general principles for a probabilistic design of load bearing structures. The more detailed aspects dealing with the probabilistic description of loads are treated in [part 2](../part-02/general-principles.md). In the same way the probabilistic description of structural resistance parameters is treated in [part 3](../part-03/general-principles.md).  

This part doesn't give detailed information about methods for the calculation of probabilities. It is assumed that the user of a probabilistic code is familiar with such methods. A clause on the interpretation of probabilities treated in this document is provided in [Annex D](annex-D-Bayesian-Interpretation-of-Probabilities.md).
