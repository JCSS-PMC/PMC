# Requirements
## Basic requirements

 Structures and structural elements shall be designed, constructed and
 maintained in such a way that they are suited for their use during the
 design working life and in an economic way.

 In particular they shall, with appropriate levels of reliability,
 fulfil the following requirements:

-   They shall remain fit for the use for which they are required
    (*serviceability limit state requirement*)

-   They shall withstand extreme and/or frequently repeated actions
    occurring during their construction and anticipated use (*ultimate
    limit state requirement*)

-   They shall not be damaged by accidental events like fire,
    explosions, impact or consequences of human errors, to an extent
    disproportionate to the triggering event (*robustness requirement*,
    see Annex A).

## Reliability differentiation

 The expression \"*with appropriate levels of reliability*\" used above
 means that the degree of reliability should be adopted to suit the use
 of the structure, the type of structure or structural element and the
 situation considered in the design, etc.

 The choice of the various levels of reliability should take into
 account the possible consequences of failure in terms of risk to life
 or injury, the potential economic losses and the degree of social
 inconvenience, as described in chapter 8. It should also take into
 account the amount of expense and effort required to reduce the risk
 of failure. It is further noted, that the

 term \"failure\" as used in this document refers to either inadequate
 strength or inadequate serviceability of the structure.

 The consequences of a failure generally depend on the mode of failure,
 specially in those cases when the risk to human life or injury exists.

 In order to provide a structure corresponding to the requirements and
 to the assumptions made in the design, appropriate *quality measures*
 shall be adopted. These measures comprise definition of reliability
 requirements, organisational measures and controls at the stages of
 design, execution and use and the maintenance of the structure.

## Requirements for durability

 The durability of the structure in its environment shall be such that
 it remains fit for use during its design working life. This
 requirement can be considered in one of the following ways:

a)  By using materials that, if well maintained, will not degenerate
    during the design working life.

b)  By giving such dimensions that deterioration during the design
    working life is compensated.

c)  By chosing a shorter lifetime for structural elements, which may be
    replaced one or more times during the design working life.

d)  By inspection at fixed or condition dependent intervals and
    appropriate maintenance activities.

 In all cases the reliability requirements for long and short term
 periods should be met. Analysis aspects on durability are described in
 Annex B.
