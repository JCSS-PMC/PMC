JCSS Probabilistic Model Code
=============================

 This document is a first attempt to put together in a consistent way
 some - certainly not all - of the rules, regulations, and explanations
 that are necessary for the design of new structures, or the assessment
 of existing ones from a probabilistic point of view. The document, of
 course, is also useful for background calculations of non
 --probabilistic codes.

 From a probabilistic point of view designing new structures, or
 accepting existing ones as sufficiently safe, is the result of a
 decision-making process guided by some optimality criteria. This
 process links, in a logical and consistent way, the requirements and
 expectations of the client or owner of a structure, the loads and
 actions to be expected, the characteristics of materials to be used or
 found in the proposed or existing structure, the calculation models,
 the grades of workmanship expected or observed on the site, the
 behaviour of the users, and, finally, in an ideal case, the
 perceptions of society with respect to environmental impact and
 sustainable development.

 The aim of this document is threefold: First, it is the attempt of a
 number of people interested in such an approach to see whether, at
 this point in time, the main problems in the development of such a
 document can be mastered. Second, it is intended to put a text into
 the hands of structural engineers who are willing now to apply new
 approaches in their work. Third, the Joint Committee on Structural
 Safety (JCSS) is convinced that such a document will spur the
 development of a Probabilistic Code covering all aspects of Structural
 Engineering.

 There are people who advocate staying with traditional
 non-probabilistic codes, claiming that data is not sufficient for full
 probabilistic methods. There is much truth in the statement that often
 data is scarce. But this holds for both approaches. Let\'s face it:
 since data is often scarce in either approach, what remains is in
 essence probabilistic. Important in this respect is the meaning of the
 word "probability". In this document a "probability" is not
 necessarily considered as a "relative frequency that can be observed
 in reality". Such a straightforward interpretation is possible for
 dice and card games, but not for structural design where uncertainties
 must be modelled by complicated probabilistic models and which
 interact in a complex way. Here, probabilities are understood in the
 Bayesian way, expressing degrees of belief in relation to the various
 uncertainties, and suitable to decision making processes. At best,
 probabilities can be interpreted as "best estimates" of the relative
 frequencies, sometimes being wrong on the one side, sometimes on the
 other the degree of deviation from reality being a direct function of
 the state of knowledge. More discussion on this topic can be found on
 Annex X of Part 1, Basis of Design.

 The present version of this JCSS Probabilistic Model Code document is
 available on the Internet at [www.jcss-lc.org](https://www.jcss-lc.org/). It is
 intended that the document will be adapted and extended a number of
 times in the years to come. To get the best possible and efficient
 improvements all users are invited to send their questions, comments
 and suggestions to [www.jcss-lc.org](https://www.jcss-lc.org/) The
 JCSS hopes that this document - the most recent of its
 pre-codification work since its creation in 1972 - will find its way
 into the practical work of structural engineers.
