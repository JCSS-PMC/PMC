# Basis of uncertainty modelling

## Basic variables

The calculation model for each limit state considered should contain a
specified set of basic variables, i.e. physical quantities which
characterize actions and environmental influences, material and soil
properties and geometrical quantities. The model should also contain
model parameters which characterize the model itself and which are
treated as basic variables (compare [4.2](section-4.2)). Finally there are also parameters which describe the requirements (e.g. serviceability
constraints) and which may be treated as basic variables. The basic
variables (in the wide sence given above) are assumed to carry the entire input
information to the calculation model.

The basic variables may be random variables (including the special
case deterministic variables) or stochastic processes or random
fields. Each basic variable is defined by a number of parameters such
as mean, standard deviation, parameters determining the correlation
structure etc.

## Types of uncertainty

Uncertainties from *all essential sources* must be evaluated and
integrated in a basic variable model. Types of uncertainty to be taken
into account are:

- intrinsic physical or mechanical uncertainty
- statistical uncertainty, when the design decisions are based on a
  small sample of observations or when there are other similar
  conditions
- model uncertainties (see [5.6](section-5.6)).

Within given classes of structural design problems the types of
probability distributions of the basic variables should be
standardized. These standardizations are defined in the parts [2](../part-02/general-principles.md) and [3](../part-03/general-principles.md) of the probabilistic model code.

## Definition of populations

The random quantities within a reliability analysis should always be
related to a meaningfull and consistent set of populations. The
description of the random quantities should correspond to this set and
the resulting failure probability is only valid for the same set.

The basis for the definition of a population is in most cases the
physical background of the variable. Factors which may define the
population are:

- the nature and origin of a random quantity
- the spatial conditions (e.g. the geographical region considered)
- the temporal conditions (e.g. the intended time of use of the
  structure considered)

The choice of a population is to some extent a free choice of the
designer. It may depend on the objective of the analysis, the amount
and nature of the available data and the amount of work that can be
afforded.

In connection with theoretical treatment of data and with the
evaluation of observations it is often convenient to divide the
largest population into sub-populations which in turn are further
divided in smaller sub-populations etc. Then it is possible to study
and distinguish variability within a population and variability
between different populations.

In an analysis for a specific structure it may be efficient to define
a population as small as possible as far as use, shape and location of
the structure are concerned (microzonation). When the results are used
for design in a national or international code, it may be necessary or
convenient to put the sub-populations together to the large population
again in order not to get too complicated rules (randomizing). This
means that the variability within the population is increased.

## Hierarchy of uncertainty models

This section contains a convenient and recommended mathematical
description in general terms of a hierarchical model which can be used
for different kinds of actions and materials. The details of this
model have to be stated more precisely for each specific variable. The
model is associated with a hierarchical set of subpopulations.

The hierarchical model assumes that a random quantity $X$ can be written
as a function of several variables, each one representing a specific
type of variability:

```{math}
:label: eq3
X_{ijk} = f(Y_i,Y_{ij},Y_{ijk})
```

The $Y$ represent various origins, time scales of fluctuation or spatial scales of fluctuation.

For instance $Y_i$ may represent the building to building variation,
$Y_{ij}$ the floor to floor variation in building $i$ and $Y_{ijk}$ the point
to point variation on floor $j$ in building $i$.

In a similar way, $Y_i$ may represent the constant in time variability,
$Y_{ij}$ a slowly fluctuating time process and $Y_{ijk}$ a fast fluctuating
time process.
